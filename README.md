# charmm-vs-openmm-energies

[![Travis Run](https://travis-ci.com/olllom/charmm-vs-openmm-energies.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/olllom/charmm-vs-openmm-energies)

CHARMM reference energies for OpenMM and openmmtools tests.
The tests are defined in the README.md files in the subdirectories.

Travis parses the reference energies and runs CHARMM calculations
to make sure that the reported energies are accurate.
